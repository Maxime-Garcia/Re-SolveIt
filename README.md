# Re-SolveIt #
## Introduction ##
This game was made during a game jam organized by Ynov in Aix-en-Provence. The purpose was to test our ability as Game Designers to create a game with constraints.

## The Game ##
The main purpose of this game is to solve some kind of a puzzle by rotating the plate and letting the ball roll all around it. You'll have to activate color buttons to get the appropriate color in order to solve the puzzle. And don't forget about the mix of colors ! 

## Constraints ##
- A die and retry game
- No enemies
- Weird controller
- Non-linear
